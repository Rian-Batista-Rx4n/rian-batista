# 🪟 Rx4n Portfolio — Windows XP Inspired Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a creative web project inspired by the classic look and feel of **Windows XP**.

This project isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a nostalgic, interactive experience that reimagines the old desktop environment in modern web form.  
Each icon, window, and app on the screen represents a different section of my digital world.

---

## 💡 Concept

The goal of this portfolio is to blend **retro design** with **modern web development**, creating a fully interactive “desktop” where you can explore my projects, social media, and personal story — all while feeling like you’re back in the early 2000s.

Everything you see is built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (no frameworks), to keep the charm of classic web simplicity.
