# 🪟 Rian Batista (Rx4n) — Windows XP Inspired Portfolio

Welcome to my **personal portfolio**, a creative and nostalgic web project inspired by the classic look and feel of **Windows XP** 🖥️.

- 🌐 Access here: **Portfolio:** [rian-batista-rx4n.github.io/rian-batista](https://rian-batista-rx4n.github.io/rian-batista/)

This isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a fully interactive **retro desktop experience** that blends **old-school design** with **modern web development**.  
Each icon, window, and app on the screen represents a different part of my digital world.

## 💡 Concept

The goal of this project is to merge **retro aesthetics** with **modern web technologies**, recreating the Windows XP environment directly in your browser — no emulators, no frameworks, just **pure code**.

Every element is built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, capturing the nostalgic charm of early 2000s computing while keeping everything responsive and modern.
